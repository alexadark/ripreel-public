THE FAMILY BUSINESS


A Godfather-style crime drama


FADE IN:


INT. DON'S STUDY - DAY

Dark wood paneling absorbs the light. Venetian blinds filter golden afternoon sun into horizontal stripes across an ornate mahogany desk.

DON VITO CASTELLANO (60s), silver-haired patriarch with hooded eyes, sits in a leather throne. An orange cat purrs in his lap. His face is half-hidden in shadow - only his jaw and hands visible in the amber light.

BONASERA THE UNDERTAKER (50s), nervous, stands before him wringing his hands.

BONASERA
I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion.

The Don strokes his cat slowly. Says nothing.

BONASERA (CONT'D)
She was beaten. By two boys. They made her face like a monster. I went to the police, like a good American. And the judge gave them... suspended sentences.

DON CASTELLANO
(barely audible)
Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?

BONASERA
I wanted to be a good American.

The Don's hand stops on the cat. The room feels smaller.

DON CASTELLANO
And now you come to me on the day of my daughter's wedding, and you ask me for murder.

BONASERA
I ask for justice.

DON CASTELLANO
That is not justice. Your daughter is still alive.

The Don leans forward, his eyes still in shadow.

DON CASTELLANO (CONT'D)
Someday, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me. Until that day, accept this justice as a gift.


EXT. CASTELLANO ESTATE - DAY

WIDE SHOT of a lavish Italian-American wedding. Hundreds of GUESTS feast at long tables beneath white tents. A WEDDING BAND plays on stage. CHILDREN chase each other between dancing couples.

The stone mansion rises behind the celebration, warm in the afternoon sun.

In the distance, across the street, two FBI AGENTS photograph license plates.

CONNIE CASTELLANO (20s), radiant bride, dances with her new husband CARLO.

MICHAEL CASTELLANO (30), the Don's youngest son, sits apart from the celebration with his girlfriend KAY (late 20s). He wears a Marine uniform.

KAY
Michael, that man over there is taking pictures of the license plates.

MICHAEL
(shrugs)
FBI. They do it at all the weddings.

KAY
Your family's weddings?

MICHAEL
My father's a powerful man. Powerful men have enemies.

She studies his face.

KAY
But not you. You're not part of all this.

MICHAEL
That's right. I'm not my father, Kay.


INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Harsh fluorescent lights buzz overhead. The corridor stretches empty, linoleum gleaming.

MICHAEL (now in civilian clothes) walks quickly, footsteps echoing. His face is tight with controlled fear.

He passes an empty nurse's station. An abandoned gurney.

He stops at Room 217. The door is open. The bed is empty.

MICHAEL
(whispered)
Pop...

He spins, scanning the corridor. At the far end, a shadow moves.

Michael presses against the wall, reaches into his coat. His hand comes out empty - he has no weapon.

An OLD NURSE appears, pushing a mop bucket.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
The patient in this room. Vito Castellano. Where is he?

NURSE
They moved him. About an hour ago. Some men came, showed badges...

Michael's face hardens. He understands.

MICHAEL
Which way is the back stairwell?


INT. HOSPITAL - DON'S NEW ROOM - NIGHT

Michael pushes his father's bed into a dark storage room. Medical equipment crowds around them.

DON CASTELLANO lies unconscious, tubes in his arms, face pale. Michael leans close.

MICHAEL
I'm with you now, Pop. I'm with you.

He hears footsteps in the corridor. Many footsteps.

Michael moves to the door, peers through the crack. FOUR MEN in dark coats walk past, checking room numbers.

Michael's hand finds his father's. The old man's eyes flutter open.

DON CASTELLANO
(barely audible)
Michael...

MICHAEL
Shhh. I won't let anything happen to you.

The footsteps pass. Michael exhales.


INT. LOUIS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A quiet Italian restaurant. Red checkered tablecloths. Candles in Chianti bottles cast warm light.

MICHAEL sits in a booth facing SOLLOZZO (50s), a drug dealer with dead eyes, and CAPTAIN McCLUSKEY (50s), corrupt cop with a broken nose.

They speak in Italian. Michael nods, appears to agree.

SOLLOZZO
(in Italian)
I'm glad you came, Michael. Your father understands business.

Through the window, the lights of an elevated train approach.

MICHAEL
(in Italian)
I have to use the bathroom.

McCLUSKEY pats him down roughly.

MCCLUSKEY
Clean.

Michael walks to the back. The train rumbles closer.

INT. RESTAURANT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Michael enters. Locks the door. His hands shake.

He reaches behind the toilet tank. His fingers find cold steel.

He pulls out a snub-nosed REVOLVER. Checks the cylinder. Full.

The train thunder grows deafening.

Michael looks at himself in the cracked mirror. His eyes are calm now. Empty.

He opens the door.

INT. LOUIS RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Michael walks back to the table. The train roars past, its lights washing through the windows.

He sits. Picks up his fork. Sets it down.

Sollozzo leans forward, speaking Italian, making a point.

Michael's hand comes up with the revolver.

CLOSE ON: Sollozzo's eyes widening.

Michael fires. Once. Twice.

McCluskey reaches for his gun. Michael turns.

Three shots into McCluskey's chest.

The bodies slump. Wine glass shatters.

The train passes. Silence.

Michael drops the revolver. It clatters on tile.

He walks out the door. Doesn't look back.


INT. CHURCH - DAY

Incense rises in golden shafts of light. A PRIEST stands at the baptismal font, white robes gleaming.

MICHAEL (now older, harder) holds his infant NEPHEW in a christening gown. CONNIE weeps nearby.

PRIEST
Michael Francis Rizzi, do you renounce Satan?

MICHAEL
I do renounce him.

CUT TO:

EXT. BARBERSHOP - DAY

A MAN reclines in a barber's chair, face covered in hot towels.

The BARBER steps back. TWO MEN enter, revolvers drawn.

PRIEST (V.O.)
And all his works?

MICHAEL (V.O.)
I do renounce them.

GUNSHOTS. The mirrors shatter.

CUT TO:

INT. MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

Steam. A FAT MAN lies on a table.

A MASSEUR pulls a garrote from his pocket.

PRIEST (V.O.)
And all his pomps?

MICHAEL (V.O.)
I do renounce them.

The wire tightens.

CUT TO:

INT. REVOLVING DOOR - DAY

A MAN IN A HAT pushes through a revolving door.

ANOTHER MAN enters behind him. Pulls a pistol.

PRIEST (V.O.)
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?

MICHAEL (V.O.)
I will.

GUNSHOT through the glass.

CUT TO:

INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

The PRIEST pours holy water over the baby's head.

PRIEST
I baptize you in the name of the Father...

Michael's face is serene. Beatific.

PRIEST (CONT'D)
...and of the Son...

CLOSE ON: A single drop of water falling.

PRIEST (CONT'D)
...and of the Holy Spirit.

Michael takes the baby from the font. Holds it close.

His eyes meet the camera. They are cold. Empty.

The eyes of a man who has traded his soul for power.


FADE TO BLACK.


THE END
